**Why Flavors?**



When you want to build different apps for different environments, Falvors come into an use. Flavors gives us flexibility to access relative data of specific environments.

Also, let's suppose you you are working on SAAS products where you have mulitple organizations of similar category. For example.
We have School A and School B which are member of the product. All Functions are almost similar, and schools have different Themes, Data, Logo, Icons etc. With flavors you can build different apps different appId which can be uploaded to playstore respectively.
